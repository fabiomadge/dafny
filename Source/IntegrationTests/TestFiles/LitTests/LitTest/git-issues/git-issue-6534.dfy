// The prelude had an axiom saying that every box is the box of a value of every type,
// which is false: at bool, every box would be $Box(true) or $Box(false). No program is
// known to prove false by it; the axioms themselves had no model (see the issue). The fix
// deletes it, and relies instead on the inverse for a box known to hold a value of the
// type. Proofs about fields had relied on the deleted axiom, so the fix also says that the
// value a field holds in the heap is a box of the field's type. Each constructor below
// needs that: its postcondition is about the box of the value just stored in a field.
